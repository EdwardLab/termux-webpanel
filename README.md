# Termux WebPanel Project

Termux Webpanel allows you to remotely monitor the status of your Android device (without root), such as battery level (especially useful when sharing a hotspot and putting your phone in a backpack, so you only need to check the battery level in the client browser), WIFI connection information, etc.
